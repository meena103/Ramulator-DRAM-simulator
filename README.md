# Ramulator: DRAM Simulator
- Ramulator is a fast and cycle-accurate DRAM simulator that supports a wide array of DRAM standards, here in this implementation of the simulator code we demostrated program for DDR3 (DRAM Standard). 
- For the ramulator's generalized template of various DRAM standards we have improvised and increased the efficiency of the simulator by making some changes into standard template of the Ramulator,inside DDR3 state machine template , taken DDR3 standard and written C++ code for state and functions in Ramulator_generalized_template_DDR3_state_machine.h
