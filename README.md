# Ramulator: DRAM Simulator
- Ramulator is a fast and cycle-accurate DRAM simulator that supports a wide array of DRAM standards, here in this implementation of the simulator code we demostrated program for DDR3 (DRAM Standard). 
- For the ramulator's generalized template of various DRAM standards we have improvised and increased the efficiency of the simulator, taken DDR3 standard and written C++ code for state and fucntions in Ramulator_generalized_template_DDR3_state_machine.h
